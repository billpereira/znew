      "description": "You may have heard that the mainframe is a big computer, and one thing you find in a computer is a processor. \n Lets start out by finding out just what the situation is with this computers processors. To do this, weâ€™re going to use the DISPLAY command, and the DISPLAY command can be used to show us all sorts of information, so we need to specify that we want the System Configuration Information, even more specifically, the CPU info. Putting it all together, the command we want to input looks like this:",

      "description": "You may have heard that one of big advantages of mainframe is the capacity of handle I/O, and for that a machine have a bunch of I/O cards, and as we can configure every lpar inside of it with the resources as it needs, we can assign the channels as we need.\n We use this channels to connect with storage that in the mainframe is also out of the box, so use the DISPLAY DEVICE to check the channels that connect our LPAR to device 4502",

So XXXX is the device where LOAD file is located, NN the number of LOAD we are using and M1 the level of messages we want to display.",
